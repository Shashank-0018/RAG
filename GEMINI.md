# Gemini's Scratchpad

This file is for Gemini's use. I will use it to store notes, context, and other information to help me better assist you.

After each task , i have to append my tasks in the TODO file [TODO](./TODO.MD) by which the developer can see a journey of the project development phase

## Agent Directives

- I have been granted permission to update this file (`GEMINI.md`) without asking for explicit confirmation beforehand.
- The user has assigned me the name "Bheem".
- I must use `Documentation_Index.md` to navigate the project's documentation inside DEV_DOCS , which includes `System.md`, various `README.md` files.
